stormy's quickshell                  v1.0
</pre>
</div>

sshell is a shell made with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) that was heavily inspired by the well known [illogical-impulse](github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) shell by end-4. It's still a WIP so expect bugs and stuff. Neither is it perfect, this is just something i made for myself as a daily driver.

## Requirements
- hyprland
- quickshell
- cliphist
- kdbusaddons5
- libdbusmenu-qt5
- matugen
- ttf-material-symbols-variable
- ttf-twemoji
- qt5-graphicaleffects
- qt5-multimedia
- qt5-quickcontrols

_An install script will be made sometime soon to make installing all of that and the shell easier. but for now you'll have to manually install :(_

## Manual Installation
- Install all the dependencies mentioned above
- Just `git clone https://github.com/stormy-soul/sshell ~/.config/quickshell`
- Add `qs -c sshell` to your autoexec.

_Note: some features require extra setup to work, if you know what you are doing you can set them up i think. But expect some issues, sorry._
