stormy's quickshell                  v1.0
</pre>
</div>

sshell is a shell made with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) that was heavily inspired by the well known [illogical-impulse](github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) shell by end-4. It's still a WIP so expect bugs and stuff. Neither is it perfect, this is just something i made for myself as a daily driver.

## Requirements

- quickshell (duh)
- hyprland
- qt6-base
- qt6-declarative
- qt6-wayland
- qt6-5compat
- qt6-multimedia
- qt6-shadertools
- qt6-svg
- qt6-quicktimeline
- networkmanager
- bluez
- bluez-utils
- cliphist
- imagemagick
- matugen
- playerctl
- brightnessctl
- jq
- ttf-material-symbols-variable-git

And optionally,

- starship
- fish
- ttf-cascadia-code-nerd
- ttf-jetbrains-mono
- ttf-twemoji
- inter-font

_I might have missed some packages probably, so do let me know if you find any missing ones_

## Installation

- Just `git clone https://github.com/stormy-soul/sshell` and `cd` into it
- And then use `./installer.sh help` for the available options

_Note: I'm not sure if everything will work fine out of the box for you, but it works on my pc_
